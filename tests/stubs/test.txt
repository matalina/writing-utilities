A warm, westerly wind tossed Brandon’s dark locks. A hint of magic and smoke where-no-fire-burned floated on the breeze, whispering, "Touched in the womb." 
Brandon growled and bolted out of his purple velvet couch on his penthouse balcony overlooking the Tyrrhenian Sea. He grabbed the black iron railing. His knuckles white from the strain. Brandon stared out onto the open water. Somewhere to the west He made another agent — a child yet to be born. “Sticking your fingers in the pie again. I will see to that,” he said in a heavy Italian accented English to the aether.
A faster-than-human whirl and Brandon strut inside the modern penthouse he kept in Ostia. 
An old black 1920s-replica rotary phone sat on the nightstand. 
Brandon grabbed the perfectly polished handset and dialed 0. 
The soft hum of the dial ending with a voice, “How many I help you Mr. Holt?”
